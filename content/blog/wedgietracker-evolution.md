Hey there! I'm excited to announce a complete redesign of WedgieTracker.com, and I wanted to share a bit about our journey and where we're headed next.

## How It All Started

Back in early 2021, during those long pandemic days, I found myself mindlessly scrolling through Twitter while working my day job developing WordPress themes at an agency. That's when WedgieTracker was born – initially just a simple page with an embedded Twitter feed tracking basketball's most unusual stat.

The site immediately gained traction, and what started as a simple page quickly evolved into a full-fledged WordPress website packed with custom features. The feedback started pouring in through social media and email, leading to our second version.

One of my favorite moments was hearing WedgieTracker mentioned during an NBA broadcast for the first time, and we even had a dedicated fan get our first t-shirt design tattooed!

<blockquote>
Thank goodness, a basketball-minded person got that url!

</blockquote>

Since then, every mention during NBA, Euroleague, or minor league games still gives me goosebumps.

While we kept adding new pages and functions to the WordPress site, I found myself wanting to do more. The platform was starting to feel limiting, and the incredible feedback kept coming (special shoutout to Richard, the professor who did a research [paper on wedgie prevalence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cqvWlODasMptjQwNAyiEEYp4iSSkShzf/view?usp=sharing)).

## The Next Chapter: Open Source and Community

This brings us to today's exciting announcement: WedgieTracker has been completely refactored using Next.js with the T3 stack, and we've made the entire project [**open source!**](https://github.com/wedgietracker/wedgietracker) This isn't just a redesign – it's a complete reimagining of what WedgieTracker can be.

With this relaunch, we're also introducing a [unique store concept](/store): our t-shirt inventory is directly linked to the total number of wedgies. Every time a new wedgie happens in a game, a new t-shirt drops. But this isn't just about merch – the t-shirt sales are meant to fund our next wedgie-related project, which I promise will be our biggest and best yet.
